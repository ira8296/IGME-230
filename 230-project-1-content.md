        <p id="introduction"> Mario Survival is an arcade shooter game based off of the Mario series in which you can play as different Mario characters while you fight off an invasion by Bowser and his minions, with the goal being to survive as long as possible for all five levels. The project overall does not only focus on the game itself, but it also goes further into depth, describing the entire process of developing the game and giving credit to all of the resources used in the making of this project. Mario is one of my favorite video game characters and in the previous years I've been playing games online based on Mario, which have been developed by other designers as tribute to the long-running successful game franchise. Therefore, I also wanted to follow in these footsteps and become an impressive game designer myself.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>   Overall, the process in creating this website for the game hasn't been all that difficult. The only problems I encountered with the project were the coinciding due dates for other projects and time management. Development went along very steadily, and very few issues popped up along the way. Any information I needed was  mostly on the web page's CSS, which I found on the website, w3schools.com. I found all of my images off of Google Images, except for my ID photo, which I took personally. I made sure to meet all of the requirements for each page as I went along by checking back on the rubric from timet to time and applying any necessary changes to my website.</p>
